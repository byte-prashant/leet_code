brute-focre--> all combinations--> if  overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure--> dp
if optimal substructure--> gredy
if states are limited or event limited==> finite state machine


Way to solve dp problem---
 1) In recursion problems, where we find brute force algorithms will always look for all 
combinations  solutions 
 2) then we apply top down , memoization to save solutions of those sub problems and fetch that ans again
    when that subprob reccur
 3) we can further optimize it using tabulation, where we solve small sub problems and then these solution
   are used to get the the ans of original problem
 4) we can also use greedy algorihtm sometime (where we want to get optimized ans (max/min/largest/smallest))

POINTS--
1) try to find the similar core recursive problem/solution it will help to write the bottom up problem
.....will work on content
